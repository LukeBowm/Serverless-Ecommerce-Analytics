# Serverless E-commerce Analytics Pipeline

## Overview
This project demonstrates a serverless architecture for processing and analyzing e-commerce data using AWS services. It simulates a real-world scenario where transaction data is ingested, processed, analyzed, and visualized without requiring actual e-commerce platform connections.

## Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](docs/images/architecture-diagram.png)

The solution utilizes the following AWS services:
- **API Gateway**: Provides RESTful endpoints for data ingestion
- **Lambda**: Handles data processing and business logic
- **SNS/SQS**: Manages messaging between components
- **EventBridge**: Orchestrates event-driven workflows
- **DynamoDB**: Stores processed data
- **AppFlow**: Integrates with external systems (simulated)
- **S3**: Hosts data lake and static website content

## Features
- Real-time transaction data processing
- Customer behavior analytics
- Inventory tracking and alerting
- Business insights dashboard
- Scalable serverless architecture

## Technical Implementation
The project demonstrates these key serverless patterns:
